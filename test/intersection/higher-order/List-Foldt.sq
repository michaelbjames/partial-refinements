There are more than just fold-left and fold-right. There's a tree-like fold
that's valid if the operation is associative and symmetric (e.g., (-) :: Int ->
Int -> Int is symmetric but not associative). So a tree-like fold:
foldt (+) [1,2,3,4] 0 = (1 + 2) + (3 + 4)

from: https://wiki.haskell.org/Fold
foldt            :: (a -> a -> a) -> a -> [a] -> a
foldt f z []     = z
foldt f z [x]    = x                             -- aka foldt' of data-ordlist
foldt f z xs     = foldt f z (pairs f xs)

foldi            :: (a -> a -> a) -> a -> [a] -> a
foldi f z []     = z
foldi f z (x:xs) = f x (foldi f z (pairs f xs))  -- aka foldt of data-ordlist

pairs            :: (a -> a -> a) -> [a] -> [a]
pairs f (x:y:t)  = f x y : pairs f t
pairs f t        = t

data List a where
  Nil :: List a
  Cons :: x: a -> xs: List a -> List a

termination measure len :: List a -> {Int | _v >= 0} where
  Nil -> 0
  Cons x xs -> 1 + len xs

{-
Before we can build foldt and foldi, we need a strong enough pairs function.
It should produce the ceil(len(xs) / 2) elements by combining them.

Here we encounter a bug: these two types are logically equivalent, yet
Synquid only accepts the implication based one.

While both specs can check, they are not strong enough to synthesize what we
want.
